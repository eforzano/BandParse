# BandParse
This is a continued project worked on by Ernie Forzano and Herbert Gutierrez. The python script allows the user to enter a band name. This band name is then sent to LastFM's API in order to get a list of similar bands. This list comes as a JSON file and is converted to a python list. This list is then parsed and then sent to BandsInTown's API in order to get all of the events that the artists are playing. 

Future Goals: 
To set up the python script as the back end with flask. 
The front end is going to be a simple user interface using JavaScript. 
Another intended goal is to take that list of bands and create a YouTube playlist from the artists.
